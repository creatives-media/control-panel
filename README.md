# Disclaimer

- This is how the project was structured before adopting the [iVer concept](https://github.com/frontfacer/iVer).<br>
- While different marks and versions were created inside this folder, they are now considered as part of the first mark, the <b>mk1</b>.<br>
- To be noted that the beacon of this folder is "sebastian-photos". A different folder was created to offer flexibility for each platform where the panel could be found, while maintaining the same style and concept through a global "@config" folder.
